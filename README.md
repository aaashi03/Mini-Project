# 🛡️ DOS Detection System Using Python & Scapy

A mini project for detecting **Denial of Service (DOS)** attacks in real-time using Python. This system utilizes the **Scapy** library to monitor network packets, analyze traffic frequency and patterns, and raise alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

## 📌 Project Description

Denial of Service attacks can disrupt critical digital infrastructure. This project provides a proactive DOS detection system that monitors real-time traffic and uses a **sliding time window** to detect abnormal request frequencies from specific IPs. If a single IP exceeds the predefined threshold within a given time frame, the system triggers an alert.
